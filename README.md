# 🔢 Basic Calculator – Intro to Python Assignment

## 📌 Description
This is a simple Python calculator program created as part of an introductory Python assignment. It allows a user to input two numbers and perform a basic arithmetic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

## 🎯 Objective
- Practice using variables, input/output, and conditionals.
- Perform arithmetic operations based on user input.
- Learn basic error handling (e.g., division by zero).

## ▶️ How It Works
1. The user enters two numbers.
2. The user selects an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
3. The program performs the operation and displays the result.
